## ‚ùì What is stUART? 

Stuart is an i2c communication protocol, that uses 2 wires to interface between two circuits (**CLK** and **DATA**) and send 8 bit frames (similarly to UART) but this is a simplistic _"very stupid"_ method for simple embedded applications. 

This repository **contains the C/C++ library** implementation for microcontrollers or programmable chip(set)s.
